/* Generates `public/` image files from their sources in `assets/`, which is the source of record for
   every image on the site. `output: "export"` copies `public/` wholesale into `out/`, so an original
   left there ships to every guest unreferenced.

   Deliberately not a `prebuild` step: the deploy must not depend on this script succeeding, and a
   generation failure must fail loudly here rather than silently drop an image from a build.
